        <h1>The Warrior's Dark Fantasy Game</h1>
        <h3 class="intro1">
          <p>
            The warrior groaned as he slowly sat up, rubbing his head. He
            couldn't remember how he had gotten here, in this dark and misty
            swamp. The last thing he remembered was sitting at a dinner table
            with his wife and children, laughing and joking. He had no idea how
            he had ended up in this strange place.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he looked around, he noticed that he doesn't have any weapons or
            armor. He had no idea where he was or what was happening, but he
            knew that he was a warrior, and he would fight to survive.
          </p>
          <p>
            He stood up, his legs unsteady beneath him. He looked around, trying
            to get his bearings. The mist was thick, making it difficult to see
            more than a few feet in front of him. He could hear the sounds of
            animals in the distance, but nothing that he recognized.
          </p>
          <p>
            He took a deep breath and set off into the unknown. He knew that he
            had to find a way out of this swamp and back to his family. He had
            no idea what was waiting for him, but he was ready for whatever lay
            ahead.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he walked, he felt a sense of determination growing within him.
            He would not be defeated by this place, this misty swamp. He was a
            warrior, and he would fight to survive and return to his family. The
            journey ahead would be long and difficult, but he was ready for it,
            even without weapons and armor. He would have to be resourceful and
            smart.

          <h2>Text about what happened</h2>
          <p>
            The warrior stood in the middle of a dark and misty swamp. The
            ground beneath his feet was soft and spongy, covered in a thick
            layer of moss. The mist was so thick that he could barely see more
            than a few feet in front of him. The air was damp and musty, and the
            only sound was the distant croaking of frogs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trees surrounding him were twisted and gnarled, their branches
            reaching out like gnarled fingers. The leaves were a sickly green,
            and the bark was black and rotting. The water in the swamp was dark
            and still, with a thick layer of algae on top.
          </p>
          <p>
            The warrior knew that he had to find a way out of this place, but he
            had no idea which direction to go. He could either forge ahead,
            blindly making his way through the swamp, or he could try to climb a
            nearby tree to see if he could get a better view of his
            surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The warrior weighed his options, his hand on his chin. He knew that
            going forward blindly could be dangerous and time-consuming. On the
            other hand, climbing a tree could give him a better idea of where he
            was and where he needed to go. He took a deep breath and decided
            that it was worth a try. He approached the tree, looking for a good
            spot to begin his climb.
